Mini Golf Physics Game

A top-down physics-based mini golf game built with raylib. Master the perfect shot with realistic ball physics and strategic power control.
Description
Experience the challenge of mini golf from a bird's-eye view! This physics-driven game tests your precision and planning as you navigate each hole. Drag to aim, release to shoot, and watch realistic physics bring your shots to life. With only 3 attempts per hole, every stroke counts toward achieving your best score.
Features

Realistic Physics - Authentic ball movement with momentum and friction
Intuitive Controls - Drag-and-release mechanic for natural shot control
Top-Down Perspective - Clear view of the entire course for strategic planning
Score System - Track your performance across all holes
Limited Attempts - 3 tries to achieve your best possible score
Visual Trajectory - See your aim direction before you shoot

Gameplay
Navigate the ball through each course and sink it in the hole using the fewest strokes possible. Your score accumulates across all holes - lower is better!
How to Play

Position Your Shot - Click and hold on the ball
Aim - Drag your mouse in the opposite direction you want the ball to go
Set Power - The further you drag, the more force will be applied
Release - Let go to strike the ball
Watch the Physics - The ball will travel in the opposite direction with corresponding force
Reach the Goal - Get the ball in the hole within 3 attempts

Controls

Mouse Click & Drag - Click on ball, drag to aim (ball moves opposite to drag direction)
Mouse Release - Execute shot with the set power and direction

Physics Mechanics
The game features realistic physics simulation:

Force Application - Drag distance determines shot power
Momentum - Ball carries velocity based on applied force
Friction - Ball gradually slows down over time
Collision - Ball interacts with walls and obstacles
